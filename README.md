Payment Gateway Integration 
#GRIPAUGUST21 #TheSparksFoundation
I have made this website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for a orphanage through which we can donate to a orphanage using a payment gateway. I have made this website under my internship in The Sparks Foundation, GRIPAUGUST2021 under task#3.

Problem Statement:
1. Create a simple website where payment gateway is integrated.
2. There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc.
3. Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. 
4. The invoice will contain the amount on any page/email, only basic information is needed.
5. Create your own temporary/sandbox/testing accounts with 3rd party for integrations.
6. Host the website at 000webhost, github.io, heroku app or any other free  hosting provider. Check in code in gitlab.

Technologies used:
1. For frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
2. For Payment Gateway: Razorpay
3. For Testing: Tested using Sandbox/Third party application
4. For Hosting: Deployed on “github.io”
